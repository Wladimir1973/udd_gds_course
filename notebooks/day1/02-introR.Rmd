# Why R?

* Freely available language and environment for statistical computing and graphics
* Provides a wide variety of statistical and graphical techniques. 
* Widespread use in academia and industry. 
* Expandable through libraries hosted on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org). 

**RStudio** is often used to implement R coding

* An integrated development environment (IDE) for R
* Provides a more user-friendly front-end to R than the front-end provided with R.

To run R or RStudio, just double click on the R or RStudio icon. We will use RStudio:

![Fig. 1. RStudio features.](../figs/rstudio_features.png)

If you would like to know more about the various features of RStudio, watch this [video](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/) 

# Setting the working directory

Use 
```
setwd()
```

Note: It is good practice to not include spaces when naming folders and files. Use *underscores* or *dots*.

# R Scripts vs Notebooks

An *R script* :

* A series of commands that you can execute at one time and help you save time. 
* An R script is just a plain text file with R commands in it. 

## To create an R script in RStudio:

* Open a new script file: *File* > *New File* > *R Script*

* Write some code on your new script window by typing eg. `mtcars`

* Run the script. Click anywhere on the line of code, then hit *Ctrl + Enter* (Windows) or *Cmd + Enter* (Mac) to run the command or select the code chunk and click *run* on the right-top corner of your script window. If do that, you should get:
```{r}
mtcars
```

* Save the script: *File* > *Save As*, select your required destination folder, and enter any filename that you like, provided that it ends with the file extension *.R*

An *R Notebook*

* An R Markdown document with descriptive text and code chunks that can be executed independently and interactively, with output visible immediately beneath a code chunk.

## To create an R Notebook:

* Open a new script file: *File* > *New File* > *R Notebook*

![Fig. 2. YAML metadata for notebooks.](../figs/rnotebook_yaml.png)

* Insert code chunks, either:

1) Use the *Insert* command on the editor toolbar;
2) Use the keyboard shortcut *Ctrl + Alt + I* or *Cmd + Option + I* (Mac); or,
3) Type the chunk delimiters ` ```{r} ` and ` ``` `


In a chunk code you can produce text output, tables, graphics and write code! You can control these outputs via chunk options which are provided inside the curly brackets eg.

```{r, include=FALSE}
hist(mtcars$mpg)
```

![Fig. 3. Code chunk example. Details on the various options can be found [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)](../figs/codechunk.png)

* Execute code: hit *"Run Current Chunk”*, *Ctrl + Shift + Enter* or *Cmd + Shift + Enter* (Mac)

* Save an R notebook: *File* > *Save As*. A notebook has a `*.Rmd` extension and when it is saved a `*.nb.html` file is automatically created. The latter is a self-contained HTML file which contains both a rendered copy of the notebook with all current chunk outputs and a copy of the *.Rmd file itself.

Rstudio also offers a *Preview* option on the toolbar which can be used to create pdf, html and word versions of the notebook. To do this, choose from the drop-down list menu `knit to ...`

## Getting Help

You can use `help` or `?` to ask for details for a specific function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
help(sqrt) #or ?sqrt
```

And using `example` provides examples for said function:
```{r, fig.margin = TRUE, fig.cap = 'Example sqrt'}
example(sqrt)
```

## Variables and objects

An *object* is a data structure having attributes and methods. In fact, everything in R is an object! 

A *variable* is a type of data object. Data objects also include list, vector, matrices and text.

* Creating a data object

In R a variable can be created by using the symbol `<-` to assign a value to a variable name. The variable name is entered on the left `<-` and the value on the right. Note: Data objects can be given any name, provided that they start with a letter of the alphabet, and include only letters of the alphabet, numbers and the characters `.` and `_`. Hence AgeGroup, Age_Group and Age.Group are all valid names for an R data object. Note also that R is case-sensitive, to agegroup and AgeGroup would be treated as different data objects.

To save the value *28* to a variable (data object) labelled *age*, run the code:
```{r}
age <- 28
```

* Inspecting a data object

To inspect the contents of the data object *age* run the following line of code:
```{r}
age
```

Find out what kind (class) of data object *age* is using:
```{r}
class(age) 
```

Inspect the structure of the *age* data object:
```{r}
str(age) 
```

* The *vector* data object

What if we have more than one response? We can use the `c( )` function to combine multiple values into one data vector object:
```{r}
age <- c(28, 36, 25, 24, 32)
age
class(age) #Still numeric..
str(age) #..but now a vector (set) of 5 separate values
```

Note that on each line in the code above any text following the `#` character is ignored by R when executing the code. Instead, text following a `#` can be used to add comments to the code to make clear what the code is doing. Two marks of good code are a clear layout and clear commentary on the code.

# Basic Data Types in R

There are a number of data types. Four are the most common. In R, **numeric** is the default type for numbers. It stores all numbers as floating-point numbers (numbers with decimals). This is because most statistical calculations deal with numbers with up to two decimals.

* Numeric 
```{r}
num <- 4.5 # Decimal values
class(num)
```

* Integer
```{r}
int <- as.integer(4) # Natural numbers. Note integers are also numerics.
class(int)
```

* Character
```{r}
cha <- "are you enjoying this?" # text or string. You can also type `as.character("are you enjoying this?")`
class(cha)
```

* Logical
```{r}
log <- 2 < 1 # assigns TRUE or FALSE. In this case, FALSE as 2 is greater than 1
log
class(log)
```

* Factor

A factor variable assigns a numeric code to each possible category (*level*) in a variable. Behind the scenes, R stores the variable using these numeric codes to save space and speed up computing. For example, compare the size of a list of `10,000` *males* and *females* to a list of `10,000` `1s` and `0s`. At the same time R also saves the category names associated with each numeric code (level). These are used for display purposes.

For example, the variable *gender*, converted to a factor, would be stored as a series of `1s` and `2s`, where `1 = female` and `2 = male`; but would be displayed in all outputs using their category labels of *female* and *male*.

**Creating a factor**

To convert a numeric or character vector into a factor use the `factor( )` function. For instance:
```{r}
gender <- c("female","male","male","female","female") # create a gender variable
gender <- factor(gender) # replace character vector with a factor version
gender
class(gender)
str(gender)
```

Now *gender* is a factor and is stored as a series of `1s` and `2s`, with `1s` representing `females` and `2s` representing `males`. The function `levels( )` lists the levels (categories) associated with a given factor variable:
```{r}
levels(gender)
```
The categories are reported in the order that they have been numbered (starting from `1`). Hence from the output we can infer that `females` are coded as `1`, and `males` as `2`.

# Data Frames

R stores different types of data using different types of data structure. Data are normally stored as a *data.frame*. A data frames contain one row per observation (e.g. wards) and one column per attribute (eg. population and health).

We create three variables wards, population (`pop`) and people with good health (`ghealth`). We use 2011 census data counts for total population and good health for wards in Liverpool.

```{r,results='hide'}
wards <- c("Allerton and Hunts Cross","Anfield","Belle Vale","Central","Childwall","Church","Clubmoor","County","Cressington","Croxteth","Everton","Fazakerley","Greenbank","Kensington and Fairfield","Kirkdale","Knotty Ash","Mossley Hill","Norris Green","Old Swan","Picton","Princes Park","Riverside","St Michael's","Speke-Garston","Tuebrook and Stoneycroft","Warbreck","Wavertree","West Derby","Woolton","Yew Tree")
pop <- c(14853,14510,15004,20340,13908,13974,15272,14045,14503,
                14561,14782,16786,16132,15377,16115,13312,13816,15047,
                16461,17009,17104,18422,12991,20300,16489,16481,14772,
                14382,12921,16746)
ghealth <- c(7274,6124,6129,11925,7219,7461,6403,5930,7094,6992,
                 5517,7879,8990,6495,6662,5981,7322,6529,7192,7953,
                 7636,9001,6450,8973,7302,7521,7268,7013,6025,7717)
```

Note that `pop` and `ghealth` and `wards` contains characters.

## Creating A Data Frame

We can create a data frame and examine its structure:
```{r}
df <- data.frame(wards, pop, ghealth)
df # or use view(data)
str(df) # or use glimpse(data) 
```

## Referencing Data Frames

Throughout this module, you will need to refer to particular parts of a dataframe - perhaps a particular column (an area attribute); or a particular subset of respondents. Hence it is worth spending some time now mastering this particular skill.

The relevant R function, `[ ]`, has the format `[row,col]` or, more generally, `[set of rows, set of cols]`.

Run the following commands to get a feel of how to extract different slices of the data:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
df # whole data.frame
df[1, 1] # contents of first row and column
df[2, 2:3] # contents of the second row, second and third columns
df[1, ] # first row, ALL columns [the default if no columns specified]
df[ ,1:2] # ALL rows; first and second columns
df[c(1,3,5), ] # rows 1,3,5; ALL columns
df[ , 2] # ALL rows; second column (by default results containing only 
             #one column are converted back into a vector)
df[ , 2, drop=FALSE] # ALL rows; second column (returned as a data.frame)
```

In the above, note that we have used two other R functions:

* `1:3` The colon operator tells R to produce a list of numbers including the named start and end points.

* `c(1,3,5)` Tells R to combine the contents within the brackets into one list of objects

Run both of these fuctions on their own to get a better understanding of what they do.

Three other methods for referencing the contents of a data.frame make direct use of the variable names within the data.frame, which tends to make for easier to read/understand code:
```{r, eval=FALSE}
df[,"pop"] # variable name in quotes inside the square brackets
df$pop # variable name prefixed with $ and appended to the data.frame name
# or you can use attach
attach(df)
pop # but be careful if you already have an age variable in your local workspace
```

Want to check the variables available, use the `names( )`:
```{r}
names(df)
```

## Read Data {#sec_readdata}

Ensure your memory is clear
```{r}
rm(list=ls()) # rm for targeted deletion / ls for listing all existing objects
```

There are many commands to read / load data onto R. The command to use will depend upon the format they have been saved. Normally they are saved in *csv* format from Excel or other software packages. So we use either:

* `df <- read.table("path/file_name.csv", header = FALSE, sep =",")`
* `df <- read("path/file_name.csv", header = FALSE)` 
* `df <- read.csv2("path/file_name.csv", header = FALSE)`

```{r}
census <- read.csv("../data/census_data.csv")
head(census)
# NOTE: always ensure your are setting the correct directory leading to the data. 
# It may differ from your existing working directory
```

# Manipulation Data Using `tidyverse`

## Adding New Variables

Usually you want to add / create new variables to your data frame using existing variables eg. computing percentages by dividing two variables. There are many ways in which you can do this i.e. referencing a data frame as we have done above, or using `$` (e.g. `census$pop`). For this module, we'll use `tidyverse`:

```{r}
census <- census %>% mutate(per_ghealth = ghealth / pop)
```
Note we used a *pipe operator* `%>%`, which helps make the code more efficient and readable - more details, see [Grolemund, Garrett, and Hadley Wickham, 2019](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). When using the pipe operator, recall to first indicate the data frame before `%>%`.

```{marginfigure}
Grolemund, Garrett, and Hadley Wickham. 2019. [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz). O’Reilly, US.
```

Note also the use a variable name before the `=` sign in brackets to indicate the name of the new variable after `mutate`.

## Selecting Variables

Usually you want to select a subset of variables for your analysis as storing to large data sets in your R memory can reduce the processing speed of your machine. A selection of data can be achieved by using the `select` function:

```{r}
ndf <- census %>% select(ward, pop16_74, per_ghealth)
```

Again first indicate the data frame and then the variable you want to select to build a new data frame. Note the code chunk above has created a new data frame called `ndf`. Explore it.

## Filtering Data

You may also want to filter values based on defined conditions. You may want to filter observations greater than a certain threshold or only areas within a certain region. For example, you may want to select areas with a percentage of good health population over 50%:

```{r}
ndf2 <- census %>% filter(per_ghealth < 0.5)
```

You can use more than one variables to set conditions. Use "`,`" to add a condition.

## Joining Data Drames

When working with spatial data, we often need to join data. To this end, you need a common unique `id variable`. Let's say, we want to add a data frame containing census data on households for Liverpool, and join the new attributes to one of the existing data frames in the workspace. First we will read the data frame we want to join (ie. `census_data2.csv`).

```{r}
# read data
census2 <- read.csv("../data/census_data2.csv")
# visualise data structure
str(census2)
```

The variable `geo_code` in this data frame corresponds to the `code` in the existing data frame and they are unique so they can be automatically matched by using the `merge()` function. The `merge()` function uses two arguments: `x` and `y`. The former refers to data frame 1 and the latter to data frame 2. Both of these two data frames must have a `id` variable containing the same information. Note they can have different names. Another key argument to include is `all.x=TRUE` which tells the function to keep all the records in `x`, but only those in `y` that match in case there are discrepancies in the `id` variable.

```{r}
# join data frames
join_dfs <- merge(census, census2, by.x="code", by.y="geo_code", all.x = TRUE)
# check data
head(join_dfs)
```

## Saving Data

It may also be convenient to save your R projects. They contains all the objects that you have created in your workspace by using the `save.image( )` function:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
save.image("gds.RData")
```

This creates a file labelled "week1_envs453.RData" in your working directory. You can load this at a later stage using the `load( )` function.

```{r,eval=FALSE}
load("gds.RData")
```

Alternatively you can save / export your data into a `csv` file. The first argument in the function is the object name, and the second: the name of the csv we want to create.

```{r, eval=FALSE}
write.csv(join_dfs, "join_censusdfs.csv")
```


```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
file.edit(
  tint:::template_resources(
    'tint', '..', 'skeleton', 'skeleton.Rmd'
  )
)
```

```{r bib, include=FALSE}
# create a bib file for the R packages used in this document
knitr::write_bib(c('base', 'rmarkdown'), file = 'skeleton.bib')
```
