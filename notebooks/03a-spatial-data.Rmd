# Spatial Data is *Special*

* Type of data
* Distinctive attributes
* Challenges

# Traditional data

Attributes:

* Collected for a purpose
* Granular information (deep)
* High quality

Challenges:  

* Costly - resource intensive
* Coarse aggregations
* Temporally slow

# New forms of data

## Spatial Data types

```{marginfigure}
Rowe, F. Arribas-Bel, D. 2021. [Spatial Modelling for Data Scientists](https://gdsl-ul.github.io/san/).
```

Different classifications of spatial data types exist. Knowing the structure of the data at hand is important to think of appropriate analytical methods.

![Fig. 2. Data Types.](../figs/datatypes.png)
Area / Lattice data source: [Önnerfors et al. (2019)](https://www.scribd.com/document/428488199/Eurostat-regional-yearbook-2019). Point data source: [Tao et al. (2018)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.trc.2017.11.005). Flow data source: [Rowe and Patias (2020)](https://doi.org/10.1080/21681376.2020.1811139). Trajectory data source: [Kwan and Lee (2004)](http://www.meipokwan.org/Paper/Best_2003.pdf).

*Lattice/Areal Data*  

* Correspond to records of attribute values (e.g. population counts) for a fixed geographical area. 
* Regular (e.g. grids or pixels) or irregular shapes (e.g. states, counties or travel-to-work areas).

*Point Data*  

* Records of the geographic location of an discrete event.  
* Number of occurrences of geographical process at a given location.  

*Flow Data*  

* Records of measurements for a pair of geographic point locations or pair of areas.  
* Capture the linkage or spatial interaction between two locations.  

*Trajectory Data*

* Records of moving objects at various points in time. 
* Composed of a single string of data recording the geographic location of an object at various points in time.

# Hierarchical Structure of Data

Smaller geographical units are organised within larger geographical units.

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE, results="hide"}
library(sf)
oa_shp <- st_read("../data/Liverpool_OA.shp")
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
head(oa_shp[,1:4])
```

# Key Challenges

Major challenges exist when working with spatial data.

## Modifible Area Unit Problem (MAUP)

The MAUP represents a challenge that has troubled geographers for decades.

Two aspects of the MAUP are normally recognised in empirical analysis:

* *Scale*. The idea that a geographical area can be divided into geographies with differing numbers of spatial units.

* *Zonation*. The idea that a geographical area can be divided into the same number of units in a variety of ways.

```

> MAUP can greatly impact our results and capacity to make inferences, leading to wrong conclusions

### Solutions?

No solution!

Potential mitigation strategies:

* Analysis at different geographical scales  
* Use the smallest geography available > create random aggregations > assess changes to the results
* Use functional areas

## Ecological Fallacy

An error in the interpretation of statistical data based on aggregate information e.g.

* [Robinson (1950)](https://doi.org/10.1093/ije/dyn357): country of birth and literacy

```

## Spatial Dependence

Refers to the spatial association of values for an indicator, esp. **spatial proximity of more similar (or less similar)** than expected for randomly associated pairs of observations.

## Spatial Heterogeneity

Refers to the **uneven distribution** of a variable’s values across space.

## Spatial nonstationarity

It refers to **variations in the relationship** between an outcome variable and a set of predictor variables **across space**.
